# Syllabus: PCE Data Science 350, Methods for Data Analysis
#### January 5th - March 8th, 2016
#### Instructor:  Nick McClure (nickmc at uw dot edu)

## Course Description
This course is designed to build on what students have learned so far about structuring and manipulating data. By introducing core statistical techniques, students will gain tools that data scientists use to extract insights from data. Students will be asked to apply the course content to real-life scenarios and think creatively as well as critically through issues.  Because of this, the class will also focus on developing more advanced programming skills as well.  While this class mostly focuses on statistics skills, there are major parts of the class that focus on the programming and implementation of algorithms.
