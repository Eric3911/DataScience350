# Syllabus: PCE Data Science 350, Methods for Data Analysis
#### January 5th - March 8th, 2016
#### Instructor:  Nick McClure (nickmc at uw dot edu)

## Course Description
This course is designed to build on what students have learned so far about structuring and manipulating data. By introducing core statistical techniques, students will gain tools that data scientists use to extract insights from data. Students will be asked to apply the course content to real-life scenarios and think creatively as well as critically through issues.  Because of this, the class will also focus on developing more advanced programming skills as well.  While this class mostly focuses on statistics skills, there are major parts of the class that focus on the programming and implementation of algorithms.

## Course Learning Objectives
By the end of the class, students will be able to apply these methods to data and interpret and communicate their results. Topics will include:

* Programming for productionalization: Unit testing, logging, functionalization, ...
* Statistical tools for data exploration.
* Using inferential statistics to interrogate data.
* Testing and experimental design.
* Bayesian and computational statistics.

## Course Format
Each course session will be a mixture of lecture and in-class exercises. Typically the materials for each evening include presentation slides, one or more data sets, and R scripts with illustrations and exercises related to the material. There will also be 8 weekly homework assignments which will include a combination of programming and reading. There will also be a final individual project that students will work on over the course of the class.

## Course Materials
No required textbooks. All required reading will be available online as articles or free pdf's.  There will also be additional optional reading if students wish to read more on a subject, which may invlude books or textbooks.

* Required Reading Sources:
  * “[An Introduction to Data Science.](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B6iefdnF22XQeVZDSkxjZ0Z5VUE/edit)” By Jeffrey Stanton.
  * “[Statistical Thinking for Programmers.](http://greenteapress.com/thinkstats/thinkstats.pdf)” By Allen B. Downey.
* Additional Resources (optional):

## Technical Requirements
Students are expected to use personal machines in class that are able to:
* Run R [http://cran.r-project.org/] and R-Studio IDE [http://www.rstudio.com/]
* We will spend one day exploring other free tools, such as:
  * [Python V2.X](http://www.python.org/)
  * [Gephi](http://gephi.hithub.io/) (Note: Gephi is paticular on a type of Java. Last I checked, it required >= Java 1.6).

## Course Topics and Assignments by Date:
(Topics and Dates are tentative and alwasy subject to change)

| Lecture     | Date         | Topic  | Reading  |
| ----------- |--------------| -------| ---------|
| Week 1      | 2016-01-05   | Introduction; Data Exploration; R overview | -Intro DS Ch 3,9; -StatThink Ch 2. |

## Student Assessment
Students **MUST** attend at least 8 of 10 classes.  Your grade will be based on eight homework assignments and one individual project. Details on these will be handed out/distributed on the first day.

For each homework, students should submis a report that includes:
* Working code which implements the procedures specified by the assignment. Code should be easy to read and commented well.
* Appropriate text and figures/graphs describing the results. All graphs and figures should be **labeled**.

## Policies and Values:
Your gain from this course is highly dependent on your attendance and completion of the exercises.  I fully expect students to actively participate (asking questions, doing the homework, helping others).  
Students are expected to behave professionally and abide by all student policies outlined by The University of Washington Student Conduct Code. [http://www.washington.edu/cssc/]
